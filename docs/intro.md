# Welcome to Physical AI Textbook

**Physical AI: Embodied Intelligence in the Real World**

Author: Sofia Ibrahim

This textbook explores the emerging field of Physical AI — the integration of artificial intelligence with real-world physics, embodiment, sensorimotor learning, robotics, and interaction.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to AI systems that interact directly with the physical world through bodies, sensors, and actuators — unlike traditional AI that operates in digital or simulated environments.

## Why This Textbook?

- Bridges the gap between classical AI and robotics
- Covers modern topics: sim-to-real, safe RL, multi-agent systems
- Includes code examples and practical insights
- Designed for advanced undergrads, grads, and researchers

Let's begin the journey into embodied intelligence!
